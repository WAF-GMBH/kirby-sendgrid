# Sendgrid for Kirby
This plugin replaces Kirby's native email component with SendGrid. The 
implementation is optimized for use with kikokostadinov.com. It may need 
tweaking if used for other Kirby-based projects.

## Installation
1. Copy all files in this repo to `/site/plugins/kirby-sendgrid/`.
2. Run `composer install` to install the SendGrip PHP Library.
